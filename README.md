Eratosthenes.py is an implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a method to find prime numbers up to a certain value.

It accepts two command line arguments: lowerbound and n

-lowerbound {integer value} -> Sets a lower bound on the displayed prime values
-n {integer value} -> sets an upper bound on the displayed prime values.

lowerbound is defaulted at 0, which will show all prime numbers 2 through n.
n is defaulted at 100.

Please use command line arguments as follows:

python eratosthenes.py -lowerbound 500 -n 1000
